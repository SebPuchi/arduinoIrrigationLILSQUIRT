## Overview

Developed during my freshman year to solve a common dorm room problem: keeping houseplants alive during Fall, Winter, and Spring Break. The system monitors soil moisture and automatically waters plants as needed, ensuring they survive extended periods without manual care.

**Result:** First place winner at Make BC's annual Arduino engineering competition.
